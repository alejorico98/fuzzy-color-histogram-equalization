This is an implementation of the paper with some sightly variations to test over dehazed reconstructed images.

The code was built using Python 3.8.8. Scoring (PSNR and SSIM) functions were taken from the original NTIRE Challenge  (https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/ntire21/) and should be run in Matlab.

Requirements for Python environment:
cv2 -- 4.5.2
PIL -- 9.0.1
Numpy -- 1.20.3
Matplotlib -- 3.5.1

You are free to use any of these implementations but please give credit to this repository and the authors of external code used.
